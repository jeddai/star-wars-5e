  "desc": "When the glue gun is attached to a weapon, you use it in conjunction with a weapon attack to shoot a ball of super glue that splatters within a ten foot radius. The glue lasts for 30 minutes after which it dries and crumbles away. A creature that enters or ends their movement in an area covered by the glue must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become trapped by the glue. A creature trapped by the glue has its speed reduced to 0 as long as they remain stuck. As an action, a creature stuck by the glue can make a Strength saving throw to break free. You get 2 charges and after both uses, the glue gun must recharged and cannot be used again till a long rest.",
