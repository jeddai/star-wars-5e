Make a ranged weapon attack against up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 80 feet of you. Each rocket deals 1d6+1 bludgeoning damage to its target. The three rockets all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them both to hit the same, or different targets. At 5th level you can fire an additional rocket (4 rockets total). This increases by two additional rockets at 11th (6 rockets) and 17th levels (8 rockets). Once used, this gadget must be reloaded and cannot be used again until you complete a short or a long rest.",
