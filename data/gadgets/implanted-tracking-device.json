If hit, the creature takes 1d4 damage and now has a tracking device implanted within them. As long as the device is functional, and you have a datapad, you will know the direction of your quarry as long as they are on the same planet as you are.The tracking device functions for 24 hours or until you take an object interaction to deactivate it. The presence of the tracking device is not immediately noticeable to the target unless they have a passive perception score higher than your gadget saving throw DC. An intelligent creature that is aware of the presence of the tracking device can chose to cut it out from under their skin using a bladed weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage. You can chose to fire another dart and implant a tracking device under the skin of a different creature after taking a short or a long rest. However, you can have only one active tracking device at any one time.",
