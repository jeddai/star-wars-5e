Known as Avatars, these mystics vary from tyrants to inspiring leaders who are loved by their followers. Jedi can bring out extreme emotions in the people around them.

For their enemies, they bring fear, disgust, and trepidation that can make even the most hardened veteran act like a shaky rookie.",
