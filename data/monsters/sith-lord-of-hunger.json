If you roll an even number, the frightened target makes one melee attack against a random target within its reach. If there is no such target, it moves half its speed in a random direction and takes no action on that turn. This effect ends on a target if it succeeds on three saving throws against it."

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. You can increase the damage by 1d8 for each additional point spent on the ability."
